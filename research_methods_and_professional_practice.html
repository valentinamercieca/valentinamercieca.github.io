                            The Research Methods and Professional Practice module offered both practical and theoretical grounding in computing research. Over twelve weeks, I explored core topics including the scientific method, research design, data collection and analysis, alongside the ethical, legal, and professional responsibilities in technology. These insights equipped me to plan, evaluate, and conduct research; laying a foundation for my MSc capstone project. Weekly tasks, case studies, and milestone activities helped me critically engage with research strategies and reflect on professional practice in both academic and real-world contexts.                        </p>

                        <h2>Unit 1: Introduction to Research Methods and Ethics in Computing</h2>

                        <p class="big-data-paragraph">
                            This unit introduced foundational research concepts, including the scientific method and inductive versus deductive reasoning (Dawson, 2015; QuestionPro, 2021). Understanding how observations or theories shape research helped clarify how questions and approaches are formed.
                        </p>

                        <p class="big-data-paragraph">
                            We also examined ethics in computing, particularly when dealing with people or sensitive data. The Menlo Report added legal and public interest considerations to traditional ethical principles (Finn and Shilton, 2023), which felt especially relevant in the age of AI. Deckard (2023) raised timely concerns around bias, privacy, and accountability in generative AI. The seminar discussions on grading and project ideas set the module’s tone, balancing planning with critical reflection.

                        <p class="big-data-paragraph">
                            I analysed the Automated Active Response Weaponry case through the ACM and BCS codes of conduct, focusing on ethical challenges in autonomous military technologies. My post addressed obligations to avoid harm, protect public interest, and maintain accountability (ACM, 2018; BCS, 2022). I also explored whistleblowing as a professional safeguard and examined tensions between legal duties and societal impact (Culiberg & Mihelič, 2017; ICRC, 2018). This exercise reinforced the importance of applying professional codes to complex ethical dilemmas in computing.

                        <p class="big-data-paragraph">
                            This task prompted critical engagement with AI ethics. Corrêa <i>et al</i>. (2023) highlighted the lack of global harmonisation in over 200 AI guidelines, while Deckard (2023) argued for ethics grounded in practice. I proposed a tiered framework combining international standards with local accountability. This reflection strengthened my grasp of responsible research and its application in future projects.

                        <h2>Unit 2: Research Questions, the Literature Review and the Research Proposal</h2>
                        <p class="big-data-paragraph">
                            This unit strengthened my ability to frame research questions and design a structured proposal. Drawing on Dawson (2015), I learned how focused questions define scope and direction. The literature review was presented as essential for contextualising research and identifying knowledge gaps (Healey, Matthews and Cook-Sather, 2020).
                        </p>

                        <p class="big-data-paragraph">
                            I began outlining my literature review by selecting a topic, mapping core themes, and identifying research gaps – crucial groundwork for assessments later in the module.
                        </p>



                        <h3 style="font-weight: 600;" class="spaced-heading">Collaborative Learning Discussion 1: Codes of Ethics and Professional Conduct (Peer Responses)</h3>

                        <p class="big-data-paragraph">
                            Responding to three peers’ analyses of ACM case studies, I engaged with topics like medical device security, accessible design, and workplace ethics. Comparing interpretations of ACM and BCS codes deepened my understanding of ethical computing in practice and strengthened my critical and ethical reasoning.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Unit 3: Methodology and Research Methods</h2>
                        <p class="big-data-paragraph">
                            This unit clarified how research methods align with philosophical assumptions and project goals. Drawing on Saunders, Lewis and Thornhill (2019), I explored how epistemology and ontology inform methodological choices. The distinction between exploratory and conclusive designs helped assess when qualitative, quantitative, or mixed methods are appropriate. While primary data collection may not suit my topic on suspect profiling, this unit helped me evaluate feasible and ethical alternatives using secondary data.
                        </p>

                        <h3 style="font-weight: 600;" class="spaced-heading">Collaborative Discussion 1: Codes of Ethics and Professional Conduct (Summary Post)</h3>

                        <p class="big-data-paragraph">
                            This summary post built on the Unit 1 ethics discussion, incorporating peer insights on the Automated Active Response Weaponry case (ACM, no date). Their perspectives expanded my understanding of dilemmas around autonomy, privacy, and public harm. I critiqued the limitations of legal compliance, arguing that computing ethics must also reflect transparency and moral responsibility (Johnson, 2017; ICRC, 2018). Tutor feedback highlighted the depth of reflection and encouraged further thinking on societal impact.
                        </p>

                        <p class="big-data-paragraph">
                            This unit enhanced my understanding of qualitative methods such as case studies, focus groups, and observational research. Their strength lies in exploring “why” and “how” questions in context-rich environments (Kaplan and Maxwell, 2005), though I also noted their challenges with bias and limited generalisability (Priya, 2020; Wohlin, 2021). The emphasis on research trustworthiness through triangulation and reflexivity (Hoepfl, 1997) reinforced the need for ethical, rigorous qualitative design in computing research.

                        <p class="big-data-paragraph">
                            This unit examined the effective use of interviews, surveys, and questionnaires in research. I learned that interviews offer in-depth qualitative insight, while structured questionnaires enable large-scale data collection. Key lessons included designing clear, unbiased questions, balancing open and closed formats, and piloting for validity (Dawson, 2015). Ethical considerations such as anonymity and fatigue were also emphasised, alongside analysis tools like NVivo and Excel (Allsop <i>et al</i>., 2022; Learning for Action, no date). These insights improved my confidence in selecting data collection tools aligned to specific research goals.

                        <p class="big-data-paragraph">
                            This reflection focused on unethical survey practices, especially in the Cambridge Analytica scandal, where Facebook quizzes were used to extract user data without informed consent (Cadwalladr and Graham-Harrison, 2018). Similarly, the myPersonality app case highlighted the risks of poor data security and governance (Coldewey, 2018). These cases reinforced the importance of ethical safeguards and transparency in survey-based research.
