                        <h2>Unit 1: Data Visualisation for Machine Learning</h2>

                        <p class="big-data-paragraph">
                            In this first unit, I explored the critical role that data visualisation plays in both data science and machine learning. One of the key takeaways for me was how powerful visuals can be in making sense of complex data. As someone who learns visually, this really resonated with me. Visualisation is not just about making data "look nice" – it’s about discovering patterns, relationships, and insights that might otherwise go unnoticed.
                        </p>

                        <p class="big-data-paragraph">
                            We began by looking at why visualisation is necessary, especially now when data is being generated at an overwhelming pace and scale. Effective visuals can act as a bridge between raw data and human understanding, enabling clearer communication and better decision-making.
                        </p>

                        <p class="big-data-paragraph">

                            I also learned about some fundamental principles that guide good data visualisation – things like clarity, simplicity, and context.  A key takeaway from this unit was understanding the three main types of data visualisation:                        
                        </p>

                        
                        <ul class="big-data-paragraph" style="text-align: justify;">
                            <li>Explanatory – Used to communicate a clear message, combining relevant data, engaging visuals, and a compelling narrative.</li>
                            <li>Exhibitory – Seen in infographics, these visuals present data for interpretation, often depending on the audience's knowledge</li>
                            <li>Exploratory – Used for in-depth analysis, allowing users to query, search, and discover insights within a dataset.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p class="big-data-paragraph">
                            Additionally, while I have mainly used R and Python for data visualisation, this unit introduced Tableau as a new tool. I look forward to trying it out for interactive and business-focused visualisations.

                        <h2>Unit 2: Grammar and Idioms of Data Visualisation</h2>
                        <p class="big-data-paragraph">
                            Building on the foundations from the previous unit, this section delved deeper into the principles behind how data visualisations are constructed and interpreted. This week focused on understanding the "grammar" and "idioms" of visualisation – essentially, the rules and patterns that make visual communication effective.
                        </p>

                        <p class="big-data-paragraph">
                            One of the most interesting things I learned was how visualisation has always been a part of human communication – even long before modern tools and technologies. Visuals offer a way to share information without relying on spoken or written language, making them universally powerful.
                        </p>


                        <p class="big-data-paragraph">
                            We explored the basic building blocks that make up a visualisation: things like position, colour, shape, and size. These elements, known as visual encodings, are combined in various ways to represent data. Understanding how to use them effectively is like learning the syntax of a new language.
                        </p>


                        <p class="big-data-paragraph">
                            Another key concept we looked at was data and task abstraction. This involves simplifying complex datasets and aligning them with the goals of the visualisation. It helped me realise that not every chart needs to show every detail; instead, a good visualisation highlights what is important for the task at hand.
                        </p>


                        <p class="big-data-paragraph">
                            This unit enhanced my ability to critically assess different visualisation approaches. I learned to apply structured principles when designing visualisations, ensuring clarity and effectiveness in data representation. Additionally, I gained insights into how different graphical elements – such as marks, channels, and layout – can be manipulated to convey meaning more productively.
                        </p>

                        <p class="big-data-paragraph">
                            I participated in a collaborative discussion focused on evaluating the websites of Ryanair (Ryanair, no date) and EasyJet (EasyJet, no date) from a visualisation perspective. My task was to create a structured comparative report in table format highlighting key aspects such as:
                        </p>

                        <ul class="big-data-paragraph" style="text-align: justify;">
                            <li>The attributes that users focus on while navigating each website.</li>
                            <li>The types of task abstractions performed (e.g., searching for flights, comparing prices).</li>
                            <li>The ways in which data is visually represented using different marks and channels.</li>
                            <li>The colour schemes employed and their impact on user experience.</li>
                            <li>Strengths and limitations of each website from a visualisation standpoint.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p class="big-data-paragraph">
                            This exercise helped me apply the principles of visual encoding and task abstraction in a practical setting. By comparing real-world interfaces, I developed a deeper understanding of how design choices affect user perception and interaction with data.

                        <h2>Unit 3: Introduction to R for Data Visualisation</h2>
                        <p class="big-data-paragraph">
                            This week’s focus on R served more as a refresher for me, since I have already spent a fair amount of time using the language for data analysis and visualisation. Still, it was a useful opportunity to revisit the fundamentals and solidify my understanding, especially in the context of this course                        
                        </p>

                        <p class="big-data-paragraph">
                            We worked with basic R syntax and explored how to write and execute scripts using tools like Codio and RStudio. While I am already comfortable with using RStudio, trying out Codio and Google Colab gave me a chance to experiment with different development environments, which was helpful for adapting to different workflows.
                        </p>

                        <p class="big-data-paragraph">
                            The unit also covered the use of dataframes and foundational visualisation techniques – areas I have worked with before, but it was still valuable to reinforce best practices. For instance, refreshing my knowledge of how to quickly manipulate datasets and produce clean visuals with base R functions helped me fine-tune my coding habits.
                        </p>


                        <p class="big-data-paragraph">
                            While many of the concepts were familiar, I appreciated the focus on structuring data and preparing it for visualisation – something that is often overlooked but essential for meaningful analysis. I also continued to build on my experience with libraries like <i>ggplot2</i>, which remains one of my go-to tools for crafting insightful and aesthetically pleasing plots.
                        </p>




                        <h3 style="font-weight: 600;" class="spaced-heading">Data Visualisation Activities in R</h3>

                        <p class="big-data-paragraph">
                            For this unit’s practical component, I followed the book <i>R for Data Science</i> (Wickham, Cetinkaya-Rundel and Grolemund, 2023), working through an exercise that focused on visualising the Palmer Penguins dataset using <i>ggplot2</i>.
                        </p>

                        <p class="big-data-paragraph">
                            Key visualisations I created included:
                        </p>

                        <ul class="big-data-paragraph" style="text-align: justify;">
                            <li>Scatterplots to examine relationships between flipper length and body mass across different penguin species.</li>
                            <li>Colour-coded scatterplots to highlight species-specific differences.</li>
                            <li>Trend lines using <i>geom_smooth()</i>, allowing me to fit a linear model to observe relationships more clearly.</li>
                            <li>Box plots to compare distributions of bill depth across species.</li>
                            <li>Histograms and density plots to analyse body mass distributions and experiment with different binwidths to reveal patterns.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p class="big-data-paragraph">
                            Through these exercises, I developed a deeper understanding of how to effectively visualise and interpret data in R. The hands-on experience with <i>ggplot2</i> reinforced my knowledge of layering in visualisation, where different elements (e.g., points, lines, labels) can be added incrementally to refine a plot.
                        </p>

                        <p class="big-data-paragraph">
                            This unit gave me a strong foundation in using R for data visualisation, and I look forward to applying these skills to more complex datasets in future analyses.

                            To clean and organise data, I used column renaming <i>(janitor::clean_names())</i>, type conversions (e.g., turning categorical variables into factors), and numeric parsing (<i>parse_number()</i> to fix inconsistent values). I also learned to reshape data efficiently using <i>pivot_longer()</i> and <i>pivot_wider()</i>, which helped structure messy datasets for analysis.

I compared CSV, RDS, and Parquet formats, understanding their trade-offs in terms of accessibility, efficiency, and compatibility. Additionally, I used <i>problems()</i> to troubleshoot parsing errors, reinforcing the importance of data validation in real-world workflows.

                            This unit focused on using data visualisation to interpret supervised learning models, particularly classification techniques like logistic regression and decision trees. A key theme was understanding how visual tools – such as the confusion matrix, decision boundaries, and ROC curves – can make model behaviour and performance more interpretable and accessible.
                        </p>

                        <p class="big-data-paragraph">
                            I learned how classification models are trained using labelled data and how model performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC). These metrics, when visualised, provide intuitive insight into how well a model distinguishes between classes.
                        </p>

                        <p class="big-data-paragraph">
                            We also explored tree-based methods, such as decision trees, to understand how models split data into meaningful groups. Visualising these trees helped illustrate the decision logic behind each classification, offering transparency in otherwise complex model behaviour.

                        <p class="big-data-paragraph">
                            For this unit, I worked through two Jupyter notebooks: one on logistic regression and another on decision trees. These exercises (James et al., 2021) were kindly shared with me by a colleague during a seminar, which added a collaborative and practical dimension to my learning. 
                        </p>

                        <p class="big-data-paragraph">
                            In the logistic regression notebook, I explored how to fit a binary classifier to a dataset and visualise the resulting decision boundary. I also used a confusion matrix to evaluate classification outcomes and created an ROC curve to assess model performance more comprehensively.
                        </p>


                        <p class="big-data-paragraph">
                            In the decision tree exercise, I learned how to construct and visualise decision trees, interpreting how they make splits based on features and thresholds. Visualising the structure of a tree offered clear insights into how individual predictions were made, which is especially useful for non-technical stakeholders.

                        <p class="big-data-paragraph"> 
                            This unit focused on unsupervised learning, where we analyse datasets without predefined labels or outcomes. The main goal was to understand relationships between variables or observations using techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, and K-means and Hierarchical Clustering for identifying groups within the data.
                        </p>

                        <p class="big-data-paragraph"> 
                            High-dimensional data is often difficult to interpret visually, so reducing it to two or three principal components allows us to explore its structure more intuitively. Clustering models then help reveal hidden groupings or patterns within this simplified space. Together, these techniques support better understanding, segmentation, and decision-making without needing a target variable.
                        </p>

                        <p class="big-data-paragraph"> 
                            This unit deepened my understanding of how unsupervised learning can be used to explore structure in data. With PCA, I learned how to reduce the number of variables while preserving the variance in the data, and how to interpret loading plots and scores plots to understand relationships between observations and variables.

                            For this unit, I worked through James et al.’s (2021) practical exercises using R Markdown, which focused on applying PCA and clustering techniques to high-dimensional data. Compared to the previous unit’s exercises, I found these tasks more challenging, particularly because unsupervised learning lacks the guidance of a target variable. This meant I had to rely more heavily on interpretation, exploration, and visual cues to understand the structure of the data.
                        </p>

                        <p class="big-data-paragraph">
                            The exercise began with PCA, where I scaled the data, interpreted scree plots, and visualised the principal components to observe how data points were spread in lower dimensions. This helped me identify potential patterns and relationships within the dataset.
                        </p>

                        <p class="big-data-paragraph">
                            I then applied K-means clustering, experimenting with different values of k and visualising the resulting clusters. I followed this with Hierarchical clustering, using dendrograms to see how observations grouped together at different levels. Comparing the two methods helped highlight the nuances of each approach and reinforced the value of visualisation in evaluating cluster quality and coherence.

                            Completing these exercises helped solidify the importance of dimensionality reduction as a preprocessing step, especially when followed by clustering, and demonstrated how vital visualisation is when working with abstract, high-dimensional data.

                            Although the unit focused on Python, the formative activity explored interactive Sunburst charts using Plotly in R (Plotly, 2025), allowing a cross-language comparison of visualisation approaches. These charts were engaging and intuitive, especially for exploring parent-child relationships dynamically.
                        </p>

                        <p class="big-data-paragraph">
                            However, I found that as hierarchies deepened, interpretation became more difficult, and responsiveness slowed with larger datasets. This made me reflect on the importance of balancing aesthetics with clarity and usability in visualisation design.
